## Macos screen saver

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repo 

In this project I try to create a template for a very simple screen saver that loops a video using Swift and AVPlayer


In this particular example I take a video present on sonoma at the path: `/System/Library/Desktop\ Pictures/.wallpapers/Sonoma\ Horizon/`
